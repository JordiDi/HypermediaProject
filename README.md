**Visual Design**
The visual design focuses on creating a modern, clean, and professional look. Here are the key design elements and decisions:

Typography: The Poppins font is used throughout the website for its modern and clean appearance. It enhances readability while giving the text a polished look. Different font weights (300, 400, and 600) are used to create visual hierarchy and differentiate headings from body text.
Layout and Responsiveness: The layout is centered and uses consistent spacing for a balanced and aesthetically pleasing structure. Flexbox is used for alignment, and media queries ensure that the design is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
Interactive Elements: Hover effects are added to navigation links, skill bars, and portfolio items, providing visual feedback to users. Buttons have a smooth transition effect, enhancing the overall user experience.
Use of Imagery: Project thumbnails and a profile photo add a personal touch and provide visual context to the projects showcased in the portfolio section.
The design aims to provide a professional and engaging experience for recruiters, potential clients, and collaborators.
